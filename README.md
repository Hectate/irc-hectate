# irc-hectate
IRC bot made in Node.js

This bot; as can be surmised by the filename and contents, is primarily intended to tell the time remaining until a future date. Given that the original use was to see how much time was remaining during a Ludum Dare, it's default end-time is set to one such thing. If you choose to use this on your own, you'll probably want to update the nick used to allow the "admin" commands to function for you (instead of me). Clearly a nick-based security is very insecure and not recommended for anything genuinely sensitive. In my case, it's simply to prevent casual abuse. A better technique (maybe a later project for me) would be to reference a password that is stored in a separate textfile on the server (and not included with the source).

Over time I'll continue to tweak and add to this bot, for now it works and that is sufficient.
